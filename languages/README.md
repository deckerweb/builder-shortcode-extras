# Custom Translations

If you want or need custom translations different from the Community
translations above, you can do that easily:
Create your translation with "Poedit" (https://poedit.net/wordpress)
or "Loco Translate" plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)
and upload the translation file there:
  `/wp-content/languages/builder-shortcode-extras/`

for example the German version would looke like that:
  `/wp-content/languages/builder-shortcode-extras/builder-shortcode-extras-de_DE.mo`

Note: The location `/wp-content/languages/` is the global translation folder -
      if it does not exist yet in your installation just create it.
